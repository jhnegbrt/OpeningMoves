        <h2>Welcome to OpeningMoves!</h2>
        <h3>Investor & Trading Research</h3>
        <h3>Motivation: Investors and Traders alike seek to capitalize on patterns within the equities market to increase returns and profitability for themselves and clients.</h3>
        <h3>The stock-market 'open' (9:30 EST) is commonly known as one of the most critical times of the day, but its effects on the direction of the market for the rest of the day, most traders
          would concede, is difficult to determine
        </h3>
        <h3>One indicator market participants will consider is the volatility of a stock during its trading open. In other words, how much does a stock's price change (relative to its value) within 
          the first, say, 5 minutes of the day? 10 minutes of the day? And what, if anything, does this change indicate about the behavior of the stock at different points of the day?
        </h3>
        <h3>Opening moves is designed to help answer this question</h3>
        <ul>
          <h2>Input the Ticker representation of a stock or index you are interested in exploring: e.g., TSLA (Tesla Inc.) </h2>
          <h2>Then enter a threshold for percent-change you are interested in and a timeframe across which you believe this percent change may appear</h2>
          <h3>For example, if you are interested in all of the days that a certain stock moved more than 1.4% within the first 10 minutes, enter '1.4' for % change, and select 10 minutes</h3>
          <h3>OpeningMoves will then display the daily-chart for each day that met your selection criterion.</h3>
          <h3>Finally, enter the data range you are interested in retreiving data from.</h3>
